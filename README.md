# DERL

Data Eval Return Loop. A REPL-based Clojure IDE.

## Why does it exist?

Because code is data, data is code. Why are we bringing text into it?

Traditional editors are more optimized for Algol-like syntax. Parinfer and Paredit can improve the Lisp experience, but why not just stick with data.

See [the blog post](https://andrewoberstar.com/posts/2020-12-27-why-derl/) describing my motivations for more detail.

## What is it?

Right now (0.1.0) is just a JavaFX prepl client. Not exactly an IDE or embodying any of the data-oriented editing. That's to come.

## How do I use it?

1. Clone this repo
1. Run `clojure -M:derl`
